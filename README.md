Some `Octave`(`Matlab`) tasks for me.
* A caterpillar moving in a square, a sinusoid and a curve(defines explicitly).
* Generation of matrices of specified size with alternating zeros and ones, `checkerboard.m` - matrices with numbers in ascending order arranged in a serpentine pattern on the diagonal.
* Infinite pendulum.
* Normal to the surface defined explicitly and parametrically.
* Two numerical methods(bisection and newton's) for solving $` f (x) = (1 + (1+\sin{x}-\cos{x})^2-(\sin{2x}-\cos{2x}-0.2)^2) = 0 `$ on a segment $`[-3; 3]`$ and their numerical differences.
* Animation of evolute of parabola.
* Runge-Kutta method for solving systems of ordinary differential equations.
